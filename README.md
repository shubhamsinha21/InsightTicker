Project Overview

This project is a full-stack stocks and financial-insights dashboard built by following a step-by-step YouTube tutorial. The goal is to create a modern, production- ready web application that combines authentication, database integration, real-time stock search, detailed market data, and automated daily news summaries.

The project starts with a fresh Next.js setup and gradually evolves into a feature-complete platform through multiple development stages. The structure of the build follows a clear timeline:

Setting up the project structure, layouts, and global UI components

Designing the homepage with charts and real-time financial data

Implementing authentication (UI + logic)

Configuring the database and integrating user accounts

Building a daily financial news summary system

Adding live stock search and detailed stock information pages

Deploying the entire application to production

Implementing a mechanism to stop the automated daily emails

(Challenge) Extending the app with full Watchlist CRUD operations
